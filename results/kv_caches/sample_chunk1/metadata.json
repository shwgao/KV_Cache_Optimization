discovered in either 1416 or 1417 by the italian humanist and scholar poggio bracciolini. red dragon is a 2002 horror film based on the novel of the same title by thomas harris. anthony hopkins stars as psychiatrist and serial killer dr. hannibal lecter. it is a prequel to the silence of the lambs ( 1991 ) and hannibal ( 2001 ). the novel was originally adapted into the film manhunter ( 1986 ).", "tokens": [28928, 323, 520, 279, 1890, 892, 11, 279, 1193, 1732, 889, 649, 3619, 1461, 13, 93890, 51629, 323, 1156, 575, 822, 374, 264, 1841, 22671, 11639, 6566, 1514, 11, 264, 29924, 31926, 5439, 555, 270, 23063, 73791, 9620, 13, 279, 1514, 574, 1176, 10887, 304, 220, 9892, 20, 555, 29006, 48916, 462, 27625, 596, 3026, 11, 323, 574, 1176, 4756, 304, 220, 9892, 22, 13, 279, 1176, 14002, 315, 279, 1514, 13282, 264, 6445, 1160, 315, 279, 4113, 5788, 11, 3339, 279, 220, 9892, 22, 934, 37043, 459, 3062, 2038, 2592, 389, 30063, 312, 46302, 34596, 13, 304, 220, 11483, 18399, 11, 2225, 1156, 575, 822, 596, 7126, 11, 78511, 355, 1156, 575, 822, 11, 323, 38594, 11, 342, 3458, 90802, 14095, 301, 9334, 1156, 575, 822, 1652, 85, 355, 11, 1051, 7577, 520, 279, 8209, 315, 279, 8582, 13081, 295, 285, 304, 993, 467, 2403, 93890, 51629, 596, 10868, 11, 706, 3696, 392, 278, 3703, 936, 13, 520, 279, 6355, 315, 264, 502, 463, 6387, 360, 369, 279, 3290, 315, 279, 502, 13695, 902, 279, 10083, 598, 20250, 311, 3708, 311, 813, 857, 689, 11, 1156, 575, 822, 574, 279, 1193, 893, 34300, 3403, 311, 2610, 369, 420, 2361, 11, 912, 1023, 11426, 19762, 279, 12014, 11, 13126, 433, 264, 4648, 11914, 13, 304, 34781, 315, 813, 12822, 320, 220, 914, 1667, 7026, 813, 35482, 61552, 414, 323, 42702, 4221, 1047, 1903, 779, 2294, 459, 21455, 430, 568, 574, 65178, 16689, 13, 304, 279, 1060, 315, 1156, 575, 822, 596, 19163, 320, 220, 11483, 18399, 7026, 682, 315, 813, 857, 689, 10007, 315, 279, 384, 15222, 15140, 574, 1234, 1841, 96462, 258, 1122, 2585, 13, 93890, 51629, 596, 20820, 706, 3696, 392, 278, 323, 4983, 78, 11, 323, 706, 3696, 392, 278, 342, 9652, 1051, 279, 71167, 315, 279, 1841, 96462, 258, 1122, 8603, 304, 813, 857, 689, 11, 323, 220, 6786, 574, 63957, 555, 279, 38550, 315, 1521, 2380, 12678, 311, 1180, 304, 21497, 13, 279, 1841, 96462, 258, 5493, 1051, 1101, 864, 41456, 449, 5891, 337, 2641, 304, 45381, 13, 279, 8474, 3074, 374, 264, 64019, 25706, 33894, 304, 82497, 6603, 304, 294, 533, 88, 416, 12651, 309, 1430, 5439, 555, 274, 4008, 355, 61863, 355, 320, 272, 13, 220, 1591, 1389, 272, 13, 220, 6889, 1008, 883, 46338, 1063, 30335, 16579, 5238, 320, 220, 717, 11, 220, 2366, 11, 311, 387, 4839, 11, 422, 832, 5764, 264, 4762, 993, 28626, 21765, 304, 2363, 220, 23, 7609, 433, 374, 279, 22807, 40746, 64019, 33894, 505, 61386, 488, 13, 1202, 7057, 374, 279, 2132, 281, 3609, 4208, 323, 279, 12324, 1990, 279, 1403, 2294, 71167, 93890, 51629, 323, 1156, 575, 822, 75500, 355, 13, 279, 33894, 574, 312, 482, 11352, 304, 3060, 220, 9335, 21, 477, 220, 9335, 22, 555, 279, 29048, 3823, 380, 323, 18640, 281, 16499, 822, 1437, 4575, 25947, 6729, 13, 2579, 26161, 374, 264, 220, 1049, 17, 22169, 4632, 3196, 389, 279, 11775, 315, 279, 1890, 2316, 555, 270, 23063, 305, 59422, 13, 23064, 3633, 7598, 11966, 9958, 439, 73969, 323, 6275, 25534, 1377, 13, 93890, 51629, 16920, 261, 13, 433, 374, 264, 864, 43014, 311, 279, 21847, 315, 279, 32703, 1302, 320, 220, 2550, 16, 883, 323, 93890, 51629, 320, 220, 1049, 16, 7609, 279, 11775, 574, 13517, 30464, 1139, 279, 4632, 893, 99372, 320, 220, 3753, 21, 7609], "relevance_score": 1.0, "access_count": 0, "last_access_time": 1756418370.6680648, "size_bytes": 145752064, "layer_count": 32, "is_on_gpu": true}
